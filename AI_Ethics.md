The main ethical concerns with AI voice assistants is privacy, unauthorised use and discriminaition. One of the bugest cornerns with AI voice assiasntats is the ambiguity of privacy within these AI models. Users generally are not certain of how their data is captured, stored, and used, which puts distrust in AI manufacturers. AI voice assiants are always listenig and collecting data. Not only that, but there has been a lot scandalas in recent years about data privacy. For example, in 2019, The US Fedetral Trade Commision fined Facebppl $5 billion, one ofthe largest privacy- related d ever, for misleading users about how their data was used.  Mrta continyed to face many lawsuits and investigations in the US and Europe for priavy violetions and personal data. 

Businesses should be required to be 100% transparent about how user's data is being used, collected and stored. Permissions should be clear, obious and understanbale to the everyday consumer. Businesses should a,ways develop stronger privacy indicators and controls beyond simple mute buttons and lights, it should be unmistable when data is being prcoessed.
