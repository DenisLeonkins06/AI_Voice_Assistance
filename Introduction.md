 Ai voice assitants, like Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri are transforming how people use technology.These systems use natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to allow users to carry out a wide range of tasks with voice commands.Voice assitants used to be restricted to simple tasks like answering questions or setting alarms, but they have since developed the ability to control smart home appliances, help with navigation,and even makes complex tasks like shopping or language translation easier.These technolgies are now becoming ever more significant in the technological world.As we see them in our day to day lives.
# significnce
AI voice assitants has many significant implications in both consumer and professional areas. They streamline processes, save time and enhance users experiances by offering hands free control over an array of devices.From an accesibility stand point, voice assitants have made life very easy. For example people who have physical dissabilities, can interact with technology in new ways with just there voice. However, these new developments do come with critical challenges in important areas of tech. These areas inclide, data privacy, security and ethical concerns. As voice assitants become more advanced and widespread, understanding both the technical abilities and potential risks are crucial.
# statement
Fixed version:
This case study examines the development and implications of voice assistants from a societal and engineering viewpoint. It will analyze the technological foundations that make these systems work, along with potential challenges and limitations that engineers face in designing sophisticated systems. This study will explore how engineering structures and engineering principles have shaped their capabilities, while also addressing the ethical and functional challenges AI voice assistance faces.
# Viewpoint selection 
This case study will focus on two primary viewpoints:
Societal viewpoint: This viewpoint will explore how AI voice assistants have an influence on society. This case study will focus on their impact on communication,accessibility,privacy and daily life.It will also explore the ethical and social problems that come from their use. These include data privacy, digital dependency and potential bias in AI algorithms.(Wienrich, Reitelbach & Carolus, 2023).

Engineering viewpoint: 
This viewpoint will look at the technical engineering behind voice assitant development,hardware,software,system integration, and the potential obstacles engineers face in improving system efficiency,reliability and scalability (Martínez-Fernández et al., 2022).
