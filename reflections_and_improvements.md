Looking at an engineering stand point, ai voice assistants are designed with efficiency, minuscule hardware, and a well built cloud integrated in mind. They have  low latency responses and personalization is made possible due to this architecture. But this architecture can also introduce weaknesses in structure such as continuous listening, centralized biometric voice data storage and opaque consent processing. Despite their practically, these technical decisions unintentionally affect the risks of surveillance, Inside breaches, and sensitive information misuses drastically.
Research indicates that cloud based assistants face major privacy and security threats, these include data breaches and inside threats ( Bolton et al.., 2021; Kalhor & Das,2023)
A crucial improvement in this situation would be to move towards an edge first processing, which would handle common tasks locally and only escalate to cloud when necessary. This would maintain practicality and functionality whilst lowering exposure when paired with differing privacy storage.

Looking at an ethical standpoint, anthropomorphizing assistants with coded female  voices and submissive scripts normalises subservience and creates negative stereotypes 
Studies show that female voices are associated with warmth and submissiveness, shaping user perceptions and behaviors. ( Mahmood & Huang,2023; Assink,2021).
This prejudice holds unfair in social society and reflects the lack of diversity in ai development.
The design should be seen as a moral issue rather than a Ux element, according to ethical reflection. Offering options of, default to neutral or abstract voices. Or writing responses that reject abuse rather than tolerate it are some improvements I would see are fit. Transparency in data use and layered consent modes would allow users to make informed decisions, while inclusive governance including women and small groups in design and testing would aid in removing deep rooted bias. With these huge improvements we could help turn voice assistants from tools that support social injustices into mechanisms that actively combat them.
