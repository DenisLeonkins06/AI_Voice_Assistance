#Hardware Engineering
AI voice assistants rely on a combination of local device hardware and powerful cloud infrastructure. Unlike gaming PCs, most commercial assistants run on low-power embedded processors, while heavy computation happens in remote servers.
Local Device Hardware
Devices such as Amazon Echo or Google Nest typically include:
ARM-based CPU Efficient, low-power processors designed for continuous listening.
Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)
Handle wake-word detection (“Hey Siri”, “Alexa”) without wasting any unnessery power.
Far-field Microphone Arrays
Multiple microphones with beamforming to capture voice accurately in noisy rooms, devices such as an amazon alexa or echo have these types of microphones 
They also have speakers so they could say the answer back to the user
They have Connectivity modules such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for communicating with cloud servers.
